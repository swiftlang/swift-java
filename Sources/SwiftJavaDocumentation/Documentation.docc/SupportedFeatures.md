# Supported Features

Summary of features supported by the swift-java interoperability libraries and tools.

## Overview

JavaKit supports both directions of interoperability, using Swift macros and source generation 
(via the `swift-java wrap-java` command).

### Java -> Swift

It is possible to use JavaKit macros and the `wrap-java` command to simplify implementing
Java `native` functions. JavaKit simplifies the type conversions

## Detailed feature support discussion

### Unsigned integers

### Java <-> Swift Type mapping

Java does not support unsigned numbers (other than the 16-bit wide `char`), and therefore mapping Swift's (and C)
unsigned integer types is somewhat problematic. 

SwiftJava's jextract mode, similar to OpenJDK jextract, does extract unsigned types from native code to Java
as their bit-width equivalents. This is potentially dangerous because values larger than the `MAX_VALUE` of a given
*signed* type in Java, e.g. `200` stored in an `UInt8` in Swift, would be interpreted as a `byte` of value `-56`, 
because Java's `byte` type is _signed_.

#### Unsigned numbers mode: annotate (default)

Because in many situations the data represented by such numbers is merely passed along, and not interpreted by Java,
this may be safe to pass along. However, interpreting unsigned values incorrectly like this can lead to subtle mistakes
on the Java side.

| Swift type | Java type |
|------------|-----------|
| `Int8`     | `byte`    |
| `UInt8`     | `byte` ⚠️ | 
| `Int16`    | `short`   |
| `UInt16`   | `char`    |
| `Int32`    | `int`     |
| `UInt32`   | `int` ⚠️  |
| `Int64`    | `long`    |
| `UInt64`   | `long` ⚠️ |
| `Float`    | `float`   |
| `Double`   | `double`  |

#### Unsigned numbers mode: wrap-guava

You can configure `jextract` (in FFM mode) to instead import unsigned values as their unsigned type-safe representations
as offered by the Guava library: `UnsignedLong` or `UnsignedInt`.  To enable this mode pass the `--unsigned-numbers wrap-guava`
command line option, or set the corresponding configuration value in `swift-java.config` (TODO).

This approach is type-safe, however it incurs a performance penalty for allocating a wrapper class for every 
unsigned integer parameter passed to and from native Swift functions.

SwiftJava _does not_ vendor or provide the Guava library as a dependency, and when using this mode
you are expected to add a Guava dependency to your Java project.

| Swift type | Java type                                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Int8`     | `byte`                                                 |
| `UInt8`    | `com.google.common.primitives.UnsignedInteger` (class) | 
| `Int16`    | `short`                                                |
| `UInt16`   | `char`                                                 |
| `Int32`    | `int`                                                  |
| `UInt32`   | `com.google.common.primitives.UnsignedInteger` (class)️ |
| `Int64`    | `long`                                                 |
| `UInt64`   | `com.google.common.primitives.UnsignedLong` (class)    |
| `Float`    | `float`                                                |
| `Double`   | `double`                                               |

> Note: The `wrap-guava` mode is currently only available in FFM mode of jextract.

### Enums

> Note: Enums are currently only supported in JNI mode.

Swift enums are extracted into a corresponding Java `class`. To support associated values
all cases are also extracted as Java `record`s.

Consider the following Swift enum:
```swift
public enum Vehicle {
    case car(String)
    case bicycle(maker: String)
}
```
You can then instantiate a case of `Vehicle` by using one of the static methods:
```java
try (var arena = SwiftArena.ofConfined()) {
    Vehicle vehicle = Vehicle.car("BMW", arena);
    Optional<Vehicle.Car> car = vehicle.getAsCar();
    assertEquals("BMW", car.orElseThrow().arg0());
}
```
As you can see above, to access the associated values of a case you can call one of the
`getAsX` methods that will return an Optional record with the associated values.
```java
try (var arena = SwiftArena.ofConfined()) {
    Vehicle vehicle = Vehicle.bycicle("My Brand", arena);
    Optional<Vehicle.Car> car = vehicle.getAsCar();
    assertFalse(car.isPresent());
    
    Optional<Vehicle.Bicycle> bicycle = vehicle.getAsBicycle();
    assertEquals("My Brand", bicycle.orElseThrow().maker());
}
```

#### Switching and pattern matching

If you only need to switch on the case and not access any associated values,
you can use the `getDiscriminator()` method:
```java
Vehicle vehicle = ...;
switch (vehicle.getDiscriminator()) {
    case BICYCLE:
        System.out.println("I am a bicycle!");
        break;
    case CAR:
        System.out.println("I am a car!");
        break;
}
```
If you also want access to the associated values, you have various options
depending on the Java version you are using.
If you are running Java 21+ you can use [pattern matching for switch](https://openjdk.org/jeps/441):
```java
Vehicle vehicle = ...;
switch (vehicle.getCase()) {
    case Vehicle.Bicycle b:
        System.out.println("Bicycle maker: " + b.maker());
        break;
    case Vehicle.Car c:
        System.out.println("Car: " + c.arg0());
        break;
}
```
or even, destructuring the records in the switch statement's pattern match directly:
```java
Vehicle vehicle = ...;
switch (vehicle.getCase()) {
    case Vehicle.Car(var name, var unused):
        System.out.println("Car: " + name);
        break;
    default:
        break;
}
```

For Java 16+ you can use [pattern matching for instanceof](https://openjdk.org/jeps/394)
```java
Vehicle vehicle = ...;
Vehicle.Case case = vehicle.getCase();
if (case instanceof Vehicle.Bicycle b) {
    System.out.println("Bicycle maker: " + b.maker());
} else if(case instanceof Vehicle.Car c) {
    System.out.println("Car: " + c.arg0());
}
```
For any previous Java versions you can resort to casting the `Case` to the expected type:
```java
Vehicle vehicle = ...;
Vehicle.Case case = vehicle.getCase();
if (case instanceof Vehicle.Bicycle) {
    Vehicle.Bicycle b = (Vehicle.Bicycle) case;
    System.out.println("Bicycle maker: " + b.maker());
} else if(case instanceof Vehicle.Car) {
    Vehicle.Car c = (Vehicle.Car) case;
    System.out.println("Car: " + c.arg0());
}
```

#### RawRepresentable enums

JExtract also supports extracting enums that conform to `RawRepresentable`
by giving access to an optional initializer and the `rawValue` variable.
Consider the following example:
```swift
public enum Alignment: String {
    case horizontal
    case vertical
}
```
you can then initialize `Alignment` from a `String` and also retrieve back its `rawValue`:
```java
try (var arena = SwiftArena.ofConfined()) {
    Optional<Alignment> alignment = Alignment.init("horizontal", arena);
    assertEqual(HORIZONTAL, alignment.orElseThrow().getDiscriminator());
    assertEqual("horizontal", alignment.orElseThrow().getRawValue());
}
```

### Protocols

> Note: Protocols are currently only supported in JNI mode. 
>
> With the exception of `any DataProtocol` which is handled as `Foundation.Data` in the FFM mode.

Swift `protocol` types are imported as Java `interface`s. For now, we require that all
concrete types of an interface wrap a Swift instance. In the future, we will add support
for providing Java-based implementations of interfaces, that you can pass to Java functions.

Consider the following Swift protocol:
```swift
protocol Named {
    var name: String { get }

    func describe() -> String
}
```
will be exported as
```java
interface Named extends JNISwiftInstance {
    public String getName();

    public String describe();
}
```

#### Parameters
Any opaque, existential or generic parameters are imported as Java generics.
This means that the following function:
```swift
func f<S: A & B>(x: S, y: any C, z: some D)
```
will be exported as
```java
<S extends A & B, T1 extends C, T2 extends D> void f(S x, T1 y, T2 z)   
```
On the Java side, only SwiftInstance implementing types may be passed; 
so this isn't a way for compatibility with just any arbitrary Java interfaces, 
but specifically, for allowing passing concrete binding types generated by jextract from Swift types
which conform a to a given Swift protocol.

#### Returning protocol types
Protocols are not yet supported as return types.
