# ``SwiftJava``

Java interoperability for Swift. 

This project offers both ways to simplify using JNI to call from Swift code into Java libraryes (primarily centered around the `JavaKit` library),
as well as a way to generate Java wrappers around existing Swift code to ease consumption of Swift libraries from Java.
