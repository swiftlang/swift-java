# ``SwiftJava``

Java interoperability for Swift. 

This project offers both ways to simplify using JNI to call from Swift code into Java libraries (primarily centered around the `JavaKit` library),
as well as a way to generate Java wrappers around existing Swift code to ease consumption of Swift libraries from Java.

The project is in early development so please reach out on github or the [swift forums](https://forums.swift.org)
